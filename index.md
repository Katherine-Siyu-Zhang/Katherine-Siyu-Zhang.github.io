## Research Focus

To quote a scholar I deeply admire:  
> *"My ontology is realist, my epistemology is inter-subjective, my approach is social scientific."*

My research lies at the intersection of **technology, communication, and society**. I’m particularly interested in how emerging technologies shape public discourse and information ecosystems. Broadly, I focus on two areas:

### 1. Technology and Public Discourse

I explore how digital technologies — especially platforms and algorithmic infrastructures — influence public discourse. I am especially interested in how **networked publics** interpret news events and how **platform affordances** shape communicative practices and power dynamics in the digital public sphere.

### 2. Misinformation in the Age of AI

I study the new forms of misinformation enabled by AI technologies. My current work examines:
- The visual and multimodal characteristics of misinformation
- How such content is perceived, evaluated, and shared by users
- Strategies for mitigation, including corrections, nudges, and fact-checking approaches

I am a **theory-driven** researcher. I draw from **communication theory**, **social psychology**, and **cognitive science**, and employ **computational**, **experimental**, and **survey-based** methods to investigate these topics.
