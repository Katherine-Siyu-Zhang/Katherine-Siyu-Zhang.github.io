# About Mes

<img src="images/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="500" height="630">

Here is **Katherine Zhang (张思雨)**.I am a graduate student majoring in Communication.My research interests are centered on the intersection of **Technology, Communication, and Society**. Within this interdisciplinary field, my work primarily focuses on two key areas:

## 1. Technology and Public Discourse

I investigate the impact of technology on public discourse, with a specific focus on how networked publics interpret news events and how digital platforms and other new communication methods are reshaping the dynamics of public information.

## 2. Misinformation in the Age of AI

I am dedicated to understanding **the emerging forms of misinformation** that arise from AI technologies. My research examines:
- The characteristics and dissemination of visual misinformation
- The effects of such messages and individual perceptions
- Potential strategies for mitigating these issues through corrections and fact-checking messages

I am **theoretically-driven**. In my research, I adopt theoretical insights from cognitive theory, social psychology, and communication science. I apply **computational method** and **qualitative (survey and experiment) methods** to investigate the above research area.
